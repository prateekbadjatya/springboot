how Spring really does IoC using annotations?



🚗 Step 1: Create the Engine

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component   // tells Spring: "This is a bean, manage it"
class Engine {
 void start() {
 System.out.println("Engine Started!");
 }
}


Here:

@Component = Spring will create an object of Engine and keep it in the IoC container.



🚗 Step 2: Create the Car


import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component   // Spring will also manage Car
class Car {

    @Autowired   // tells Spring: "Please inject Engine here"
    Engine engine;

    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving...");
    }
}


Here:

@Autowired = Spring will automatically give the Engine object to Car.

Car doesn’t create Engine — Spring does it ✅

🚗 Step 3: Main App


import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")   // tells Spring where to find @Component classes
public class MainApp {
public static void main(String[] args) {
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MainApp.class);

        Car car = context.getBean(Car.class);   // Get Car from Spring
        car.drive();  // Output: Engine Started! Car is driving...
    }
}

.

🔹 Why do we use @Component in both Car and Engine?
1. What @Component does

When you put @Component on a class, you are telling Spring:
👉 “Please manage this class as a Spring Bean (object) inside the IoC Container.”

So:

If you write @Component on Engine, Spring will create an Engine object and keep it ready.

If you write @Component on Car, Spring will create a Car object and keep it ready.

2. Why Engine needs @Component

Car depends on Engine.

If Engine is not a Spring bean, Spring won’t know how to give it to Car.

So Engine must be marked as @Component, so Spring can create and inject it.

3. Why Car needs @Component

You also want to use Car in your application (like context.getBean(Car.class)).

If Car is not a Spring bean, Spring won’t manage it, and you can’t ask Spring for a ready-made Car.
